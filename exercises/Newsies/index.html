        <p>Friends and family I want to tell you of a wonderful thing I have discovered. Now I’m not just intending this message for just LDS members. I have been struggling sleeping and feeling sick almost constantly. I can’t seam to find solace anywhere. The pain I am in is overwhelming. However I keep getting this feeling of I want to listen to something to occupy my mind. Many of us struggle with lack of funds to find <i>“fun”</i> audiobooks to listen to. I just so happened to have the LDS Library app on my phone. <span id=blurb><strong>Not just for LDS people</strong></span>It’s free and the General Conference sections full of uplifting messages of courage and strength. It has helped me no feel better and fall asleep quicker. For my non LDS friends and family: Some of the things said may not pertain specifically to you but there is a fantastic amount of love in every message. Please feel free to ask questions to myself if you choose to listen and something doesn’t make sense we can learn together. Wit all my love and hope that you can sail through life safe of the storms and happy. </p>
